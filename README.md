It is a simplified potentiostat or a three-electrode electrochemical measurement system. A potentiostat is an essential device in electrochemical experiments, designed to control the voltage difference between the reference electrode and the working electrode while measuring the current flowing between the working and counter electrodes. 
Components and Their Roles:
1.	Op-Amp TL081 (U5, U1):
o	Single, 30-V, 3-MHz, 13-V/µs slew rate, In to V+, JFET-input op amp
o	High slew rate: 20V/µs (TL08xH, typ)
o	Low offset voltage: 1mV (TL08xH, typ)
o	Low offset voltage drift: 2 µV/°C
o	Spice Model :   https://www.ti.com/product/TL081#design-tools-simulation
2.	Op-Amp OPA333 (U2A) used in Simulation Model Instead of AD8605:
o	1.8-V, 17-µA zero-drift CMOS precision operational amplifier
o	Supply Voltage: 1.8 V to 5.5V
o	Spice Model: https://www.ti.com/product/OPA333#design-tools-simulation
3.	Counter Electrode:
o	This electrode completes the current path and helps in driving the electrochemical reactions at the working electrode.
4.	Reference Electrode:
o	The reference electrode provides a stable potential against which the working electrode's potential is controlled and measured.
5.	Working Electrode:
o	The working electrode is where the electrochemical reaction of interest occurs. The current flowing through it is proportional to the reaction occurring on its surface.
6.	Output to DSO (Digital Storage Oscilloscope):
o	The current or voltage response of the working electrode is fed to the DSO for monitoring and analysis.
________________________________________
Function of the Circuit:
1.	Input Signal: N/A
2.	Voltage Control:
o	The circuit maintains a precise voltage difference between the reference and working electrodes, as dictated by the input signal.
3.	Current Measurement:
o	The current flowing between the working and counter electrodes is related to the electrochemical reaction and is analyzed via the output signal.
Each component is critical in ensuring stable, accurate control of the electrochemical system.
